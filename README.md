# Tinkerer's Smithing

A sentimental and convenient rebalance of gear crafting, repair, combining, and smithing.

This mod:
 - Removes the XP and work cost of (enchantment-safe) unit repair for gear - Simply use a **smithing table**.
   - Also adds convenient unit repair to stone and wooden tools in any crafting grid.
 - Adds enchantment-safe upgrade paths for gear to encourage more experimentation, and "Sentimental Gear".
   - Upgrade iron gear (ex. chestplates/leggings) to diamond gear at the smithing table.
   - For convenience, upgrade wood and stone tools right from the crafting table.
   - Sacrifice any piece of netherite gear at a smithing table to upgrade gold gear to netherite.
 - Adds a way to recover "overworked"/"too expensive" enchanted gear using netherite scrap at a smtihing table.
   - Lowers the cost of future anvil operations - as if you'd worked with it one less time.


It requires [NBT Crafting](https://modrinth.com/mod/nbt-crafting), and is (secretly) just a datapack!

If you'd prefer the datapack format for any reason, you can download it straight from the [Tinkerer's Quilt Repo](https://download-directory.github.io/?url=https://github.com/sisby-folk/mc-packs/tree/quilt_1.18.2/config/openloader/data/tinkerers_smithing) (Direct Download Link)
